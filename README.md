# LunarRover2022

Hello Lunar Rover Team of OIT!

This is the repository for our Arduino code so that we can share up to date scripts.

Please upload short descriptions of what you have changed or added to this repository
 so that we can keep everything documented and organized. Thanks!

Also try NOT to "fork" this repository, as it makes sharing accurate code with
 each other a little messy. Let Nico (Nico.Baldovino28@gmail.com) know what your profile name is and he will 
  invite you to become a contributor to the main repository so you can edit and upload.

New to the Repository (& maybe GitHub)?
 Open "Introduction (Read First)" for a brief rundown on how to get started!
