Hello 2021-22 Lunar Rover Team!

This document is meant as a guide for setting up GitHub on your own laptop and connecting the repository correctly so that all of our code is easily up to date.
If you have not used GitHub before, it is a website that allows you to store and share coding files (or other files if need be) into a single repository that you can connect
 to a downloaded file folder on your device. This repository and file folder can be updated to match each others contents by pulling/pushing the updated information/code 
 using the GitHub Desktop Application that you can download from this repository link as well. I will guide you through the downloading process now:

The following link will take you to the GitHub website where I have created the repository for all of our code:
https://github.com/NicoBaldovino22/LunarRover2022

Once you have opened the link, take a look at the screenshot "GitHub Help.PNG" that I have uploaded to the repository to give you a visual reference for the following step:
First, if you have not created a GitHub account then I highly recommend you do so. Once you have made an account, star the repository linked above so that we can all have 
 the same repository to push/pull our code from.

Next, go to the green "code" tab and download the GitHub Desktop application as well as the zip folder containing everything in the repository.

This GitHub Desktop application will allow you to pull/push any updated information from the repository on the GitHub website with your downloaded repository file on your 
 hardrive (zip file) and vice versa.
However, make sure that the location of the file you unzip is set as the correct directory for communication on the desktop application.
 (you will know it is setup correctly when you make changes to the code on your computer and the GitHub Desktop Application will have a "commit changes" button in the 
  bottom left that is highlighted and will update the online repository with the changes you have made)

Usually the directory for your download of the repository will be located inside of c:/Users/your_name/Documents/GitHub and then you can move it to where it is more
 convenient if you want, but you will have to redirect your GitHub Desktop Application to wherever you moved the file folder next time you use the application.

If there are any complications or we find a slightly better way of keeping these files up to date for everyone automatically, then we will discuss it as it arises.

Thank you everyone!
